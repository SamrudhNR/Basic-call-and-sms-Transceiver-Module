# Basic-call-and-sms-Transceiver-Module
This repository guides you on how you can build a Basic Mobile Phone using STM32F407 Microcontroller and GSM A6 module. This project has 3 main components, they are:

1.GSM A6 Module
2.LCD 16x02
3.Hex Keypad
To make the programming  organized, I have developed individual driver code for interfacing GSM A6 module, LCD 16x02 and Hex Keypad on STM32F407 MCU. 
After developing these drivers I simply included these driver files in my project and used the respective APIs in the main program.
